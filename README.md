# SampleGraphQL

To run server, use command: node index

It will start your server on loclahost:8080.
Server used here: apolloserver

Database: There is no backend database integration, we have used static data source: Author
If you update anything using mutation, it will only reflect in datasource untill you re-start the server, we are not persisting the data anywhere in the code

The details of queries/mutation and other syntax are added in the file.
